## Known issues

### 1. ReferenceError: __dirname is not defined in ES module scope

**Symptom:** When running in an ES module (ESM) context, the run fails with an error similar to:

```
ReferenceError: __dirname is not defined in ES module scope
	at file:///Users/foo/Projects/bar/v5/node_modules/.pnpm/@azure+playwright@1.0.0-beta.2_@playwright+test@1.51.0/node_modules/@azure/playwright/src/core/playwrightServiceUtils.ts:7:20
	at ModuleJob.run (node:internal/modules/esm/module_job:271:25)
	at onImport.tracePromise.__proto__ (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:578:26)
	at requireOrImport (/Users/foo/Projects/bar/v5/node_modules/.pnpm/playwright@1.51.0/node_modules/playwright/lib/transform/transform.js:230:24)
```

**Cause:** `__dirname` is not available in Node.js ESM by default, and an internal dependency referenced it.

**Resolution:** Update to a version of `@azure/playwright` that includes the fix (see tracking issue: https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/35532). For example:
- npm: `npm install -D @azure/playwright@latest`
- pnpm: `pnpm add -D @azure/playwright@latest`
- yarn: `yarn add -D @azure/playwright@latest`


### 2. No dashboard/report link shown at the end of a run

**Symptom:** When a run completes, no dashboard or report URL appears in the output.

**Cause:** Detailed diagnostics reporting isnâ€™t supported in Playwright Workspaces (Azure App Testing) at this time, so a dashboard/report link isnâ€™t emitted.

**Resolution:** In the Azure portal, you can view basic run detailsâ€”browser count and durationâ€”under your Playwright Workspace > Test runs. For richer, shareable diagnostics (screenshots, traces, logs, etc.), we recommend [publishing Playwright HTML reports using Azure Storage static website hosting](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/ci-intro#publishing-report-on-the-web), a lowâ€‘cost and scalable approach.

### 3. 'useCloudHostedBrowsers' does not exist in type 'PlaywrightServiceAdditionalOptions'

**Symptom:** When service config use this additional param, the run fails with an error similar to:

```
'useCloudHostedBrowsers' does not exist in type 'PlaywrightServiceAdditionalOptions'
```

**Cause:** `useCloudHostedBrowsers` is removed from options as its not required anymore.

**Resolution:** Remove `useCloudHostedBrowsers` if used in playwright.service.config.ts

### 4. 'timeout' does not exist in type 'PlaywrightServiceAdditionalOptions'

**Symptom:** When service config use this additional param, the run fails with an error similar to:

```
'timeout' does not exist in type 'PlaywrightServiceAdditionalOptions'
```

**Cause:** `timeout` is remained to connectTimeout from package version 1.0.0

**Resolution:** Replace `timeout` with `connectTimeout` if used in playwright.service.config.ts

### 5. 'TypeError: (0 , _playwright.getServiceConfig1) is not a function'

**Symptom:** method not found in package:

```
'TypeError: (0 , _playwright.getServiceConfig) is not a function'
```

**Cause:** `getServiceConfig` is renamed to createAzurePlaywrightConfig.

**Resolution:** Rename `getServiceConfig` to `createAzurePlaywrightConfig` in playwright.service.config.ts
